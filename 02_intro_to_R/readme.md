# Intro to R - 31 August 2021

Today will begin an introduction to R through a free online resource called Software Carpentry. R is a computer language for 
statistical computing, creating figures / graphs, and manipulating large or many data files without having to manually look,
edit, or change things in a text editor or spreadsheet editor. We will be using R for almost all of the hands-on lessons
for the rest of the semester, and so you'll need to have a working understanding of how things generally work, and know 
what to look for / search on Google if you don't know how something is working. 

&nbsp;

The website for the lesson is found [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). We will be doing the lesson called
"Programming with R." Click on the data site link to this lesson. This will take you to the learning page with 15 modules. 
This is far too many to complete in class today, but it'd be great if everyone can work through module #1. On your own, prior
to September 9th, please make sure to work through slowly and comprehensively exercise #s: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 
13, and 15. This should take a few hours to work through, and if you take your time with it, will make the exercises later in
the class that much easier. 

&nbsp;

There will be a few basic multiple choice questions about R usage on the first quiz.

&nbsp;

First, make sure that the computer you are using has RStudio installed. We will use this program to implement R lessons and
code throughout the semester. Once you are ready with that, click on the "Setup" link in the Programming with R lessons page.
Once you have created the necessary directory and downloaded the files to that directory, you are ready to go with lesson 1.

# Expected Learning Outcomes

The expected learning outcomes for each of the lessons are in the third column of the schedule for the lessons. For in-class
today, you should be able to:
1. Read data into R
2. Be able to assign variables in R
3. Know what a data frame is and be able to access (i.e., use) different parts of it
4. Calculate some simple statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation
5. Learn where to look for help if you want to know more information about functions or other aspects of R
6. Be able to make a simple plot
